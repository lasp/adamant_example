description: The Ccsds_Serial_Interface_Instance receives data on the Raspberry Pi Pico UART. It is actively looking for a sync pattern followed by a CCSDS packet header. If it receives a valid CCSDS packet it forwards it along to the Ccsds_Commmand_Depacketizer_Instance. This component looks for commands in the CCSDS packet, extracts them, and then forwards them along the Command_Router_Instance for routing and later execution.
