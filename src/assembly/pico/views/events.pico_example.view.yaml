description: Events are produced by components when something interesting happens. All components send their events first to the Event_Filter_Instance. This component can enabled/disable individual events by ID. Next, events are forwarded to the Event_Limiter_Instance. This component will start limiting problematic spam events that might flood the system. Any event that passes both of these filtering components is passed to the Event_Packetizer_Instance for collection in a packet for later downlink.
filters:
  - name: evt_connections
    type: connector_type
    include:
      - Event.T
  - name: rm_connector
    type: connector_name
    exclude:
      - Event_Limiter_Instance.Event_T_Send
      - Event_Filter_Instance.Event_T_Send
