description: Any packet produced by the assembly is sent to the Ccsds_Packetizer_Instance. This component takes the Adamant formatted packets, converts them to CCSDS, and sends them asynchronously to the Ccsds_Socket_Interface_Instance. The socket interface component will take packets stored on its queue and transmit them over a network TCP socket. The Product_Packetizer_Instance periodically requests data products from the Product_Database_Instance to create packets containing data from multiple components. These packets are also forwarded to the Ccsds_Packetizer_Instance for downlink.
