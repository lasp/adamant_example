description: The Ccsds_Socket_Interface_Instance receives data from a ground system on a TCP socket. If the component receives a valid CCSDS packet it forwards it along to the Ccsds_Commmand_Depacketizer_Instance. This component looks for commands in the CCSDS packet, extracts them, and then forwards them along the Command_Router_Instance for routing and later execution.
