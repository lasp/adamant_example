description: Any component that produces faults will send them to the Fault_Correction_Instance. This component maps the fault to a response action. This action is in the form of a correction command which is sent to the Command_Router_Instance synchronously for execution. In the Linux assembly, two components can throw faults. The first is the Task_Watchdog_Instance. This component monitors some critical tasks to ensure that they are always running in a timely fashion. If one stops executing, a fault is thrown. The Fault_Producer_Instance is a simple component that throws a fault when commanded to. This can be used to inject a fault into the system for testing purposes.
