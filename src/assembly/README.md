# Example Assemblies

This directory contains the Adamant Example assemblies. Each assembly demonstrates how to connect Adamant components together, compile them into a runnable binary, and deploy that binary onto
the target hardware. Currently there are two assemblies available:

 - **linux** - This assembly compiles and runs natively in the Adamant [build environment](../../docker/README.md). To get started look [here](linux/main/README.md).
 - **pico** - This assembly cross compiles for the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). To get started look [here](pico/main/README.md).
