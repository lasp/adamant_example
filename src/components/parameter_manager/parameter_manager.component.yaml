description: This component is responsible for managing a working and default parameter table. Its sole responsibility is to respond to commands to copy parameter tables from one region to another.
execution: active
init:
  description: Initialization parameters for the Parameter Manager.
  parameters:
    - name: parameter_Table_Length
      type: Natural
      description: The size of the parameter table in bytes. This must be known to the component so it can construct correct sized memory regions for the downstream components.
    - name: ticks_Until_Timeout
      type: Natural
      description: The component will wait until it has received at least this many ticks before reporting a timeout error while waiting for a parameter update/fetch response from either the working or default parameter components. For example, if the component is attached to a 10Hz rate group and this value is set to 7, then the component will wait between 700 and 800 ms before declaring a timeout error from an unresponsive downstream component.
